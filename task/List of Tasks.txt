SOLUTION: User reasearch task 
      -make a copy of the template-slides & fill it 
      -Fill in your interview questions on the template-slide 
      -interview questions with Major Categories and sub-Categories questions

         


//////////////////TASK 2-Empathy stage task
Following the submission of your interview notes, you are to develop the following:
1. Derive A combined empathy map for all your interview scripts. You should work on a Miro canvas as described in the lesson.
2. Identify the Pain points & list them
create notes,empathy map & painpoints on Miro and do a screenshots or frame/copy to export as png & patse them on google
Create a slide presentation showing the 2 deliverables above.
Submit‌ a link of the google slides presentation as a "Text reply " by 11.59pm saturday, Apirl 10 2021 
-you can also submit the Miro link

SOLUTION: 
        - create a mirabod on mira.Com
        - make notes from interviews scripts/questions you got from  people you interviwed i.e interview notes
        - create sticky notes
        - create the empathy map-think,feel,say,do
        - copy the empathy map
        - click ...& create a frame for the sticky notes
        - click ... again & export as small image


/////////////////TASK 3 Empathy stage task
      TASK 3A  You are to create pain points

   TASK 3A solution

Deliverables
Following the submission of your Empathy map and Pain points you have been asked to work on the following:
1.Derive Your Feature List - some wow features are expeced if they don't meet your complexity versus impact criteria. 
Find a way to develop a simplify version of the wow feature.
2.Derive A user-flow diagram for your solutions
3.Derive A comprehensive User journey map for your solutions
4.Derive A comprehensive Sketch of your proposed solutions 
    -using paper& pen 
    - basmastiq
NOTE:Due to the sketches it will be advisable to screenshot & paste on a google slide presentation
However, you can paste the images of your sketches into your Miro board and share the link

Design Week 6: The Design Thinking Process III
Posted: Mon 03, May 2021

By: Charles Dim
*Please read carefully*
In our design course for Week 5, we saw how to come up with ideas to solve our potential users' pain points and how to prioritise these ideas. We also mapped out user journeys, flows and sketches to give us a clear idea of our prototype process. Well done!
For this week, we will be talking about the High Fidelity prototypes. You'll learn about elements that make a good hi-fi prototype, Native UI guidelines, Usability laws, and heuristics.
By the end of this course, you'll be able to create a hi-fi design for your online platform.

*Please read carefully*
We've come to the last stage of the design thinking process. We've gone from empathizing to defining pain points and coming up with ideas to solve those pain points. 
We've also seen how to make prototypes and tools involved in all these processes. Well done! You've worked hard.
For this week, we will be talking about the Testing phase. You'll learn about usability testing, its types, methods and tools used in this phase.
By the end of this course, you'll be able to prepare to conduct usability tests and know what to look out for during the process.
